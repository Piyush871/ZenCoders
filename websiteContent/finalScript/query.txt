I am learing dsa using cpp language. 
i am going to provide you with a link of a question you have to give me the question description and the solution of the question in the 
following format:
question description:
here goes the question description
solution:
here goes the solution code of the question

example:
question description:
Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, write a program to implement the Selection sorting algorithm.

solution:
void selection_sort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int mini = i;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[mini]) {
                mini = j;
            }
        }
        int temp = arr[mini];
        arr[mini] = arr[i];
        arr[i] = temp;
    }
}


you don't have to give anything other than this because i am going to run a python script to get this in django model so do no provide anything else other than this.
In the solution code please provide the optimal solution excluding the main function.I want just the general solution for every code .Please don't provide any explaination.

this is the link:
